This program will do two things every rising edge of pin 48.
First, it will read the value of analog in 3. It will take this value and turn it into a percentage of its max value and use this percentage as the duty cycle for a 1kHz pwm signal output on gpmc_a2.
Second, it will read a temperature sensor of address A2 on the i2c bus. If the temperature is over 34 degrees C, it will turn on pin 60.
